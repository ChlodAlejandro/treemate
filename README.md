----
Treemate is a basic flowchart builder made with React. Yes, the name is a pun on `teamate` and `tree`. Also yes, this is a ripoff of [LlamaLab's Automate's](https://llamalab.com/automate) flowchart design.

**Highly in-development. The latest commit may not be working.**

## Usage
As of now, Treemate is extremely in-development and doesn't have primary features implemented (yet). If you wish to proceed (and contribute to development), follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ChlodAlejandro/memex.git
```
2. Install npm packages.
```shell
npm install
```
At this point, you're ready to go. If you would like to test, use the Webpack Development Server to make life easier.
```shell
# This will start the npm dev server.
npm run start
```
